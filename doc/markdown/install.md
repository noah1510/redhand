# Manual installation

This documentation should work on debian based linux distributions and on windows (I would include others but I am not familiar with them feel free to add them to the scripts).

For windows please use [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) as shell, it makes it easy to manage all the dependencies and scripts similar to the linux variant.

* Then clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/noah1510/redhand.git`)
* Then change into the directory of the project (`cd "redhand"`)
* Run the build script with the init flag (`./scripts/build.sh --init`)

If you want to you can build the testgame using the following command: `./testgame/scripts/execute.sh --init`.
To see all the options for the script just run it with `--help`.

Now you can continue with [contribute to further development]() or [start making your own game]().
